## 1. Introduction
`taos-connector-odbc` is the official ODBC connector for TDengine, enabling applications written in various programming languages such as C/C++, C#, Go, Rust, Python, Node.js, and more to interact with the TDengine database. By leveraging the standardized ODBC interface, `taos-connector-odbc` facilitates seamless data writing, querying and parameter binding across different platforms and environments.

The `taos-connector-odbc` supports multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

## 2. Documentation
- To use the TDengine ODBC connector, please check [Reference Manual](https://docs.tdengine.com/tdengine-reference/client-libraries/odbc/), which includes version history, data types, example programs, API descriptions, and FAQs.
- This quick guide is mainly for developers who like to contribute/build/test the ODBC connector by themselves. To learn more about TDengine, you can visit the [official documentation](https://docs.tdengine.com).
- The TDengine ODBC connector adheres to the ODBC standard, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across various database systems. For more detailed information about ODBC standards and specifications, please refer to the [Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/microsoft-open-database-connectivity-odbc) documentation. This resource provides comprehensive insights into ODBC interfaces, methods, and other relevant details that can help deepen your understanding of how the TDengine ODBC connector operates within the broader context of ODBC applications.

## 3. Prerequisites
First, ensure that TDengine has been deployed locally. For detailed deployment steps, please refer to [Deploy TDengine](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/deploy-from-package/). Ensure that both taosd and taosAdapter services are up and running.

Afterwards, before installing and using the `taos-connector-odbc`, ensure that you have met the following prerequisites for your specific platform.

- cmake, 3.0 or above, please refer to [cmake](https://cmake.org/).
- flex, 2.6.4 or above. NOTE: win_flex_bison on windows platform to be installed.
- bison, 3.5.1 or above. NOTE: win_flex_bison on windows platform to be installed.
- odbc driver manager, such as unixodbc(2.3.6 or above) in linux. NOTE: odbc driver manager is pre-installed on windows platform.
- iconv, should've been already included in libc. NOTE: win_iconv will be automatically downloaded when building this project.

If you want to enable valgrind memory checks or test cases for programming languages other than C/C++, please refer to the following content.

In the following content of this guide, we will use the following versions as examples: Windows 11 for the Windows platform, Ubuntu 20.04 for the Linux platform, and macOS Big Sur for the macOS platform.

### 3.1 Windows Platform
- Install win_flex_bison:
  - Download from: [win_flex_bison](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison/releases/).
  - Extract the files and add the directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
- Verify Installation:
  ```
  win_flex --version
  ```
- Install ODBC Driver Manager:
  Ensure that the Microsoft ODBC Driver Manager is installed on your system. It is typically pre-installed on Windows platforms.

### 3.2 Linux Platform
- Install Required Dependencies, including the ODBC Driver Manager:
  ```
  sudo apt install flex bison unixodbc unixodbc-dev && echo -=Done=-
  ```

### 3.3 macOS Platform
- Install Required Dependencies, including the ODBC Driver Manager:
  ```
  brew install flex bison unixodbc && echo -=Done=-
  ```

## 4. Building and Installing
This section provides detailed instructions for building and installing the ODBC connector on different platforms.
Before proceeding, ensure you are in the root directory of this project.

### 4.1 Windows Platform
- Optionally, setup building environment: If you have installed Visual Studio Community 2022 on a 64-bit Windows platform, run the following command to set up the build environment:
  ```
  "\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
  ```
- Generate make files:
  ```
  cmake --no-warn-unused-cli -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=TRUE -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
  ```
  **Troubleshooting**: If compiler errors occur during the following steps, such as <path_to_winbase.h> warning C5105: macro expansion producing 'defined' has undefined behavior, retry with the following command:
    ```
    cmake --no-warn-unused-cli -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=TRUE -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DDISABLE_C5105:BOOL=ON
    ```
- Building the project:
  ```
  cmake --build build --config Debug -j 4
  ```
- Installing connector:
  This will install taos_odbc.dll into `C:\TDengine\taos_odbc\x64\` by default.
  ```
  cmake --install build --config Debug
  cmake --build build --config Debug --target install_templates
  ```
- Verify installation:
  Check if a new TAOS_ODBC_DSN registry has been set up in the Windows Registry:
  ```
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI\TDengine
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ODBC\Odbc.ini\TAOS_ODBC_DSN
  ```
### 4.2 Linux Platform and macOS Platform
- Generate make files:
  ```
  cmake -B debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  ```
- Build the project:
  ```
  cmake --build debug
  ```
- Install connector:
  ```
  sudo cmake --install debug
  cmake --build debug --target install_templates
  ```
- Verify installation:
  Check if the ODBC DSN configuration file (e.g., /etc/odbc.ini or ~/.odbc.ini) contains TAOS_ODBC_DSN entry.

## 5. Testing
### 5.1 Test Execution
The ODBC Connector testing framework uses ctest for running test cases. The test cases are located in the tests directory of the project root.

#### 5.1.1 Windows Platform
- Setup testing environment variables:
  Set the following environment variables to configure logging levels and destinations:
  ```
  set TAOS_ODBC_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
  set TAOS_ODBC_LOGGER=stderr
  ```
  Available log levels are: VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL. Lower levels provide more detailed logs.
  Available loggers are:
  - stderr: logs to standard error.
  - temp: logs to a file( `taos_odbc.log`) in the temporary directory.

- Run the tests:
  ```
  ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -C Debug
  ```

#### 5.1.2 Linux Platform and macOS Platform
- Setup testing environment variables:
  Set the following environment variables to configure logging levels and destinations:
  ```
  export TAOS_ODBC_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
  export TAOS_ODBC_LOGGER=stderr
  ```
  Available log levels are: VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL. Lower levels provide more detailed logs.

  Available loggers are:
  - stderr: Logs to standard error.
  - temp: Logs to a file( `taos_odbc.log`) in the temporary directory.
  - syslog: Logs to the system log (only available on Linux platforms; not supported on macOS).
  
- Run the tests:
  ```
  pushd debug >/dev/null && ctest --output-on-failure && echo -=Done=-; popd >/dev/null
  ```

### 5.2 Test Case Addition
All tests are located in the `./tests/` directory of the project. This directory contains subdirectories for various languages and types of tests. The basic functionality verification test cases are written in C and are located in the `c` and `taos` folders.
You can add new test files or add test cases in existing test files that comply with the testing framework standards.
For C/C++ tests, ensure they follow the CTest framework conventions.
Place new test files in the appropriate directories within the tests directory.

### 5.3 Performance Testing
Performance testing is in progress.
